The purpose of `rors` is to provide a tidy, pipeable and comprehensive R interface to local or remote [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/) (ORS) instances. `rors` currently enables analyses based on all available endpoints:

-   Qualitative and quantitative routing computations
-   Distance matrices
-   Accessibility analyses
-   Street snapping
-   Graph network export

Functions are designed to be pipeable, API calls are performed gracefully and the results are tidied up to digestible (sf) tibbles.

Another important feature of `rors` is the setup and management of local OpenRouteService instances from scratch. Local instances facilitate computationally intensive data analyses and allow the definition of custom API configurations. While it is possible to use `rors` with the official web API, requests will be very slow due to rate restrictions and therefore not really suitable for larger scale analyses.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `rors` from [GitHub](https://github.com/jslth/rors) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jslth/rors")
```

## Basic usage

To connect to a running OpenRouteService server - or to build a new one, use the workhorse function `ors_instance`:

```{r instance, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(rors)
library(sf)

# API keys are stored in the ORS_TOKEN environment variable
ors <- ors_instance(server = "public")
```

The ORS instance is then attached to the session and is automatically detected by all other functions. To perform a simple routing request, run `ors_inspect`:

```{r inspect}
ors_inspect(pharma, profile = "driving-car", level = "segment")
```

## Local instances

While `rors` can work with public API requests, it is primarily designed to be used together with local instances. The `ors_instance` family can be used to manage, control and build local ORS instances. The following code would jumpstart an initial instance, add an OSM extract of Rutland, add three routing profiles, set a random port, 100 MB of RAM and finally start the ORS instance. For more details, refer to [`vignette("ors-installation")`](https://jslth.github.io/rors/articles/ors-installation.html).

```{r local, eval=FALSE}
ors <- ors_instance()$
  set_extract("Rutland")$
  add_profiles("car", "bike-regular", "walking")$
  set_port()$
  set_ram(0.1)$
  up()
```
